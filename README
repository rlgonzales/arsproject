ars.Project 0.01 Dev.

pavel@arslogic.ca for any questions

Simple project management system

Needs authlogic to work, so naturally to run this you need to:

git clone git://github.com/pavelz/arsproject.git
cd arsproject
rake gems:install
edit config/database.yml for sensible usernames, that can create databases

rake db:create
rake db:migrate

then you're good to go. This is a development branch so you must run with webrick :)
